# A Bangla Handwritten Word Dataset Of 64 Districts` Name of Bangladesh

The Zilla-64 dataset is named according to the 64 districts name of Bangladesh. This dataset is written by 34 writers of different gender, age, and education level.
## A. Data collection

Writers of the Zilla-64 dataset were selected from various age, gender, and educational background. The proposed dataset of Bangla handwritten words was collected from 34 persons, where 58.8% male and 41.2% female. We made two types of forms to collect the data. The single word form is for the writer who wants to write each word for once, and the multiple words form for the writer who wants to write each word five times. The single word form has two pages with a total of 64 classes (36 classes on the first page and the rest on the second page). On the other hand, the multiple word form has five pages of 5 empty columns with 64 classes ( 12 classes on the first page and the rest of the four pages have equal 13 classes). Cell with the border was created in the A4-form to separate and crop the word sample. Participants were asked to write given printed words carefully and independently. After filling the forms, the collector verifies each page to ensure that it has been correctly written with given words.
